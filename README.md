## Introduction

Welcome to the [Web Full-Stack] repository on GitHub! This project serves as a comprehensive learning resource for second-year students (2ème année) studying various IT courses, including SQL, React, Laravel, Cloud Computing, and UML. Our goal is to create a structured and accessible platform where students can access course materials, practice exercises, and collaborate on their coursework.


## Courses

In this project, we have different branches corresponding to different courses.
In this project, we offer the following courses:

### SQL - MongoDB

Branch: `MYSQL-MongoDb`

**Description:** The SQL (Structured Query Language) course covers the fundamentals of database management and SQL query writing. Students will learn how to design, create, and query relational databases. Topics include data modeling, SQL syntax, database normalization, and working with popular database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

### React

Branch: `React`

**Description:** The React course is designed to introduce students to modern front-end web development using the React library. It covers the basics of React components, state management, routing, and interacting with REST APIs. By the end of this course, students will be able to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces efficiently.


### Laravel

Branch: `Laravel`

**Description:** The Laravel course focuses on server-side web application development using the Laravel PHP framework. Students will learn how to create robust and scalable web applications, implement authentication and authorization, build RESTful APIs, and work with databases. Laravel's features, including Eloquent ORM and Blade templating, will be explored.

### Cloud

Branch: `Création-d’une-application-Cloud-native`

**Description:** The Cloud Computing course delves into the world of cloud technologies and services. Students will understand cloud computing models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deploy applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, and explore containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. Topics also include scalability, security, and cost management in the cloud.

### UML

Branch: `Préparation-d’un-projet-web`

**Description:** The UML course covers the Unified Modeling Language, a standard notation used in software engineering to visualize and document software systems. Students will learn to create UML diagrams, including use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and more. These diagrams aid in software design, communication, and documentation.

Each course branch contains relevant course materials, exercises, and resources to support your learning journey in the respective field.
